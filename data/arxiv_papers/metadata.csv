2512.05057v1,Axionic tunneling from a topological Kondo insulator,"Discoveries over the past two decades have revealed the remarkable ability of quantum materials to emulate relativistic properties of the vacuum, from Dirac cones in graphene to the Weyl surface states of topological insulators. Yet the most elusive consequence of topology in quantum matter is the axionic $E\cdot B$ term in the electromagnetic response. Here we report a direct signature of axionic physics obtained through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although recent STM experiments using SmB$_6$ nanowires have been interpreted as evidence for spin-polarized currents arising from topological surface states, we show that the observed spin polarization instead originates from axionic electrodynamics. Our analysis reveals a striking voltage-induced magnetization: extremely small voltages ($\sim$ 30 meV) generate tip moments of order 0.1 $μ_B$ that reverse sign with the applied bias. The magnitude, tunability, and reversibility of this signal are consistent with an axionic $E \cdot B$ coupling, and fully account for the magnetic component of the tip density of states, ruling out static magnetism. Millivolt-scale control of spin polarization in a tunnel junction provides a new route for probing axionic electrodynamics and opens avenues for future STM and spintronics applications.","Saikat Banerjee, Anuva Aishwarya, Fei Liu, Lin Jiao, Vidya Madhavan, Eugene J.

2512.04880v1,"Controlling Carbon Nanostructure Synthesis in Thermal Plasma Jet: Correlation of Process Parameters, Plasma Characteristics, and Product Morphology","Thermal plasma has emerged as an effective approach for producing carbon nanostructures without the need for specific catalysts nor substrates. While efforts have focused on the effect of process parameters such as reaction pressure, input power or carbon source, the intricate role and relationship with plasma characteristics like density and temperature are often overlooked due to the complexity of the environment. This study addresses this gap by establishing a correlation between process parameters, plasma characteristics, and product morphology, essential for controlling the growth of carbon nanostructures. We explored the impact of carbon precursor type (CH4 and C2H2), hydrogen, pressure, and flow rate on nanostructure formation. Using in situ optical emission spectroscopy (OES), we mapped the distribution of both temperature and dicarbon molecule (C2) density within the plasma jet. We demonstrate that the growth of low-density nanostructures, such as carbon nanohorns (CNHs), is favoured at dilute C2 local densities and high temperatures, while denser nanostructures, such as onion-like polyhedral graphitic nanocapsules (GNCs), are favoured at higher C2 densities and lower temperatures. The carbon density can be controlled by the flow rate and the pressure, which in turn significantly influence the nanostructure morphology, evolving from graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) to GNCs as either parameter increases. Increasing the H/C ratio from 1 to 8 resulted in a morphological transition from CNHs to GNFs. During the synthesis, the plasma jet temperature surpassed 3,000 K, with crystalline growth occurring 50 to 100 mm below the nozzle.","Taki Aissou, Jerome Menneveux, Fanny Casteignau, Nadi Braidy, Jocelyn Veilleux",2025-12-04,2025-12-04,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04880v1
2512.04626v1,Phase transitions on the dark side of the Gross-Neveu model,"Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions exhibits a continuous transition from gapless Dirac semimetal to the gapped quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at a finite (attractive) coupling, at which the inversion and time-reversal symmetry become spontaneously broken, and the flavor O($M$) symmetry remains preserved. A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed.","Gabriel Osiander Rein, Fakher F.

2512.04602v1,Coulomb drag driven electron-hole bifluidity in doped graphene,"Motivated by the notion that a preponderance of Coulomb interactions might lead to hydrodynamics, we carry out an ab initio calculation of the charge carrier transport properties of the electron-hole plasma of doped graphene. We include both the phonon and Coulomb interactions within a momentum and band resolved Boltzmann transport formalism. We find that, under suitable conditions, the strong Coulomb drag effect induces effects like negative conductivity and joint electron-hole hydrodynamics (bifluidity) in the plasma. We also identify the exclusive electron or hole hydrodynamics. We find that there is a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the low doped regimes. Our work elucidates the roles of the microscopic scattering mechanisms that drive these hydrodynamic phenomena.","Dwaipayan Paul, Nakib H.

2512.04304v1,Electrical Conductivity of Copper-Graphene (Cu-Gr) Composites: The Underlying Mechanisms of Ultrahigh Conductivity,"Copper-graphene composite (CGC) conductors are widely considered as a potential alternative to pure copper (Cu). Yet, the effect of graphene (Gr) on the electrical conductivity of CGCs remains elusive, and their electrical performance is still controversial. This work addresses these unresolved questions by unambiguously quantifying how the electrical properties of CGCs depend on the characteristics of Gr and Cu. Gr is synthesized on Cu foils, foams, and wires by utilizing a wide range of chemical vapor deposition conditions to independently control their characteristics. Then the Gr-enhanced electrical conductivity (Δσ) is characterized for CGCs with different Cu geometries and Gr qualities. This study confirms that unprecedented electrical conductivity (Δσ = 17.1%) can be achieved only when both Gr and Cu are carefully optimized. Specifically, the study reveals three key factors: (1) Δσ is positively correlated with continuity of Gr; (2) CGCs with a continuous monolayer Gr exhibit a strong Δσ-A_s linear relation where A_s is the specific surface area of a CGC; and (3) Δσ becomes more pronounced when a Cu matrix has a curved cross-section. This work reveals the fundamental mechanisms of how Gr influences the overall electrical conductivity of CGCs and, therefore, is a crucial step toward designing and manufacturing high-performance CGC conductors for emerging applications.","Jiali Yao, Uschuas Dipta Das, Hamid Safari, Md Ashiqur Rahman Laskar, Junghoon Yeom, Umberto Celano, Wonmo Kang",2025-12-03,2025-12-03,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04304v1
2512.04251v1,Ferroelectric Hysteresis in Superconducting Bilayers,"Recently, coexisting ferroelectricity and superconductivity were reported in bilayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer graphene. Importantly, it was observed that an applied displacement field switches the superconductivity with a ferroelectric hysteresis. Such direct coupling between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity offers promising pathways for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices. However, the coupling mechanism between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that in a superconducting bilayer, the hysteretic switching of superconductivity can arise from an interlayer pairing. By deriving the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for the interlayer pairing, we show that along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop, the hysteretic exceeding of the critical polarization $P_{\textrm{c}}$ that destroys the interlayer pairing leads to the hysteretic switching of superconductivity. The condition to have a ferroelectric hysteretic superconducting state is established to be $P_{\textrm{r}}<P_{\textrm{c}}<P_{\textrm{s}}$, where $P_{\textrm{r}}$ and $P_{\textrm{s}}$ denote the remanent and saturated polarization, respectively. Crucially, our scenario of interlayer pairing yields two predictions: (1) an enhancement of the upper critical displacement field with stronger interlayer coupling and (2) a pronounced, gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, both of which provide clear pathways for experimental verification.","Yanfang Li, Xin-Zhi Li, Wen-Yu He",2025-12-03,2025-12-03,cond-mat.supr-con,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04251v1
2512.03970v1,Non-radiative energy transfer between boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride and other 2D materials,"Boron vacancies ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for two-dimensional quantum sensors capable of operating at atomic-scale proximity. However, the mechanisms responsible for photoluminescence quenching in thin hBN sensing layers when placed in contact with absorptive materials remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we investigate non-radiative Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between $V_B^-$ centers and either monolayer graphene or 2D semiconductors. Strikingly, we find that the FRET rate is negligible for hBN sensing layers thicker than 3 nm, highlighting the potential of $V_B^-$ centers for integration into ultra-thin quantum sensors within van der Waals heterostructures. Furthermore, we experimentally extract the intrinsic radiative decay rate of $V_B^-$ defects.","Fraunié Jules, Mikhail M.

2512.03863v1,Laser-induced modulation of conductance in graphene with magnetic barriers,"We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.","Rachid El Aitouni, Miloud Mekkaoui, Pablo Díaz, David Laroze, Ahmed Jellal",2025-12-03,2025-12-03,cond-mat.mes-hall,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03863v1
2512.03270v1,Curvature Potential Formulation for Thin Elastic Sheets,"Thin elastic sheets appear in systems ranging from graphene to biological membranes, where phenomena such as wrinkling, folding, and thermal fluctuations originate from geometric nonlinearities. These effects are treated within weakly nonlinear theories, such as the Foppl-von Karman equations, which require small slopes and fail when deflections become large even if strains remain small. We introduce a methodological progress via a geometric reformulation of thin-sheet elasticity based on a stress potential and a curvature potential. This formulation preserves the structure of the classical equations while extending their validity to nonlinear, multivalued configurations, and geometrically frustrated states. The framework provides a unified description of thin-sheet mechanics in regimes inaccessible to existing theories and opens new possibilities for the study of elastic membranes and two-dimensional materials.","Yael Cohen, Animesh Pandey, Yafei Zhang, Cy Maor, Michael Moshe",2025-12-02,2025-12-02,cond-mat.soft,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03270v1
2512.03205v1,A discontinuous Galerkin approach for simulating graphene-based electron devices via the Boltzmann transport equation,"Electron devices based on graphene have lately received a considerable interest; in fact, they could represent the ultimate miniaturization, since the active area is only one atom tick. However, the gapless dispersion relation of graphene at the Dirac points limits the possibility of using pristine graphene instead of traditional semiconductors in Field Effect Transistors (FET). For such a reason very accurate simulations are needed.   In Nastasi & Romano, IEEE TED (2021) a graphene field effect transistor (GFET) has been proposed and simulated adopting a drift-diffusion model. Here, electron devices whose active area is made of monolayer graphene are simulated adopting as mathematical model the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equations (BTEs) in the bipolar case, coupled with the Poisson equation for the electric field. The system is solved by means of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach (see Cockburn & Shu, J. Comp. Phys. (1998); Hesthaven & Warburton, 2008) with linear elements in the spatial coordinate and constant approximation for the wave-vector space, discretized with a polar mesh. The correct physical range for the distribution function is preserved with the maximum-principle-satisfying scheme introduced in Zhang & Shu, J. Comp. Phys. (2010).   The adopted method reveals very robust and possesses a good degree of accuracy, making it particularly well suited for capturing the complex charge transport dynamics inherent to graphene-based devices. The results for suspended monolayer graphene and GFET constitute benchmark solutions for a rigorous assessment of the validity of macroscopic models, such as drift-diffusion and hydrodynamic ones.","Giovanni Nastasi, Vittorio Romano",2025-12-02,2025-12-02,math-ph,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03205v1
2512.03149v1,A high-order regularized delta-Chebyshev method for computing spectral densities,"We introduce a numerical method for computing spectral densities, and apply it to the evaluation of the local density of states (LDOS) of sparse Hamiltonians derived from tight-binding models. The approach, which we call the high-order delta-Chebyshev method, can be viewed as a variant of the popular regularized Chebyshev kernel polynomial method (KPM), but it uses a high-order accurate approximation of the $δ$-function to achieve rapid convergence to the thermodynamic limit for smooth spectral densities. The costly computational steps are identical to those for KPM, with high-order accuracy achieved by an inexpensive post-processing procedure. We apply the algorithm to tight-binding models of graphene and twisted bilayer graphene, demonstrating high-order convergence to the LDOS at non-singular points.","Jinjing Yi, Daniel Massatt, Andrew Horning, Mitchell Luskin, J.

2512.03147v1,$α$-RuCl$_3$ intercalated into graphite: a new three-dimensional platform for exotic quantum phases,"Multilayer graphene with different stacking sequences has emerged as a powerful setting for correlated and topological phases. In parallel, progress in graphene heterostructures with magnetic or correlated materials-most notably the Kitaev candidate $α$-RuCl$_3$-has demonstrated charge transfer, magnetic proximity effects, and interfacial reconstruction, creating new opportunities for engineered quantum systems. Motivated by these developments, we explore a three-dimensional analogue in which $α$-RuCl$_3$ layers are inserted directly into the van der Waals gaps of graphite, forming an intercalated system. Here, we report the successful synthesis and comprehensive characterization of graphite intercalated with $α$-RuCl$_3$. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, quantum oscillation measurements, and first-principles electronic structure calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of these intercalated crystals. Our results demonstrate that graphite intercalated with $α$-RuCl$_3$ offers a robust route to develop three-dimensional materials with access to novel correlated and topological states.","Aleksandar Razpopov, Shirin Mozaffari, Takahiro Matsuoka, Matthew Cothrine, Nan Huang, Roser Valentí, David Mandrus",2025-12-02,2025-12-02,cond-mat.str-el,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03147v1
2512.02974v1,Altermagnetoelectric Spin Field Effect Transistor,"Spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) are promising candidates for low-power spin-based electronics, yet existing realizations that rely on spin-orbit coupling are constrained by limited material choices and short spin-coherence lengths. Here we propose a different operating principle based on multiferroic altermagnets, in which spin splitting is tuned by an electric field through symmetry control rather than conventional spin-orbit physics. Using an effective model combined with quantum transport simulations, we show that the conductance is determined by the degree of matching between the electrically controlled spin texture of the channel and the fixed spin polarization of ferromagnetic contacts, enabling clear ON and OFF states. Remarkably, we also address a long-standing challenge in multiferroic device design: spintronic channels require metallic carriers, whereas ferroelectricity is usually suppressed in metals. We resolve this conflict by imprinting multiferroic altermagnetism into highly conductive materials via the proximity effect. First-principles calculations for graphene on multiferroic vanadium sulfide halides confirm that graphene acquires a ferroelectrically switchable spin splitting while retaining its metallic character. These results establish a practical route to SFET implementation and identify multiferroic altermagnets as a versatile platform for next-generation spintronic devices.","Ziye Zhu, Xianzhang Chen, Xunkai Duan, Zhou Cui, Jiayong Zhang, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou",2025-12-02,2025-12-02,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02974v1
2512.02909v1,Electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in Dirac electron tunneling transistors,"Bistability-two distinct stable states under identical parameter-is not only a fundamental physical concept but also of importance in practical applications. While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching.","Shuai Zhang, Yang Xu, Junhe Zhang, Dihao Sun, Yinan Dong, Matthew Fu, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Cory R.

2512.02907v1,Tunable giant Purcell enhancement of quantum light emitters by means of acoustic graphene plasmons,"Inspired by the remarkable ability of plasmons to boost radiative emission rates, we propose leveraging acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs) to realize tunable, giant Purcell enhancements for single-photon, entangled-photon, and multipolar quantum emitters. These AGPs are localized inside a cavity defined by a graphene sheet and a metallic nanocube and filled with a dielectric of thickness of a few nanometers and consisting of stacked layers of 2D materials, containing impurities or defects that act as quantum light emitters. Through finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, we show that this geometry can achieve giant Purcell enhancement factors over a large portion of the infrared (IR) spectrum, up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and up to 4 orders of magnitude at telecommunications wavelengths, reaching quantum efficiencies of 95\% and 89\%, respectively, with high-mobility graphene. We obtain Purcell enhancement factors for single-photon electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), and electric octupole (E3) transitions and two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) transitions, of the orders of $10^{4}$, $10^{7}$, $10^{9}$, and $10^9$, respectively, and a quantum efficiency of 79\% for entangled-photon emission with high-mobility graphene at a wavelength of $λ=1.55$ $μ$m. Importantly, AGP mode frequencies depend on the graphene Fermi energy, which can be tuned via electrostatic gating to modulate fluorescence enhancement in real time. As an example, we consider the Purcell enhancement of spontaneous single- and two-photon emissions from an erbium atom inside single-layer (SL) WS$_2$. Our results could be useful for electrically tunable quantum emitter devices with applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing.","Justin Gruber, Mahtab A. Khan, Dirk R.

2512.02522v1,Tuning proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling in graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures,"Recently, proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been observed in heterostructures consisting of monolayer graphene (ML-G) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as WSe$_{2}$. Successful tuning of SOC in graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures by applying mechanical pressure and electric fields was also demonstrated in previous studies. In addition, theoretical calculations predicted a strong dependence of the proximity-induced SOC on the twist angle between graphene and TMDC. Here, we put these predictions to experimental test in ML-G/ML-WSe$_{2}$/hBN-heterostructures, where the twist angle is determined by aligning fractured edges, and by crystallographic etching of graphene. By performing weak anti-localization measurements, we determine the strength of the Rasbha-type SOC ($λ_\mathrm{R}$) and the valley-Zeeman-type SOC ($λ_\mathrm{VZ}$). Our experiments confirm a strong twist angle dependence of the proximity-induced SOC in agreement with theoretical predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the tunability of the SOC strength via mechanical pressure, which is in agreement with earlier findings.","Tobias Rockinger, Bálint Szentpéteri, Szabolcs Csonka, Marina Marocko, Julia Amann, Ziyang Gan, Antony George, Andrey Turchanin, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Dieter Weiss, Péter Makk, Jonathan Eroms",2025-12-02,2025-12-02,cond-mat.mes-hall,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02522v1

However, radio-frequency (RF) charge detection, which is a key technique for qubits readout, remains challenging in such systems. We demonstrate RF reflectometry with impedance matching for high-resistance quantum dot devices based on bilayer graphene and molybdenum disulfide. By integrating a tunable strontium titanate (SrTiO3) varactor into a resonant circuit, we achieve nearly perfect impedance matching, enabling sensitive charge detection. The demodulated RF signal clearly shows Coulomb oscillations, and the SrTiO3 varactor exhibits robustness against both magnetic fields and voltage noise on the varactor. Our results establish SrTiO3 varactors as effective tunable matching components for RF reflectometry in high-resistance 2D material quantum devices, providing a foundation for high-speed qubits readout.","Motoya Shinozaki, Akitomi Shirachi, Yuta Kera, Tomoya Johmen, Shunsuke Yashima, Aruto Hosaka, Tsuyoshi Yoshida, Takeshi Kumasaka, Yusuke Kozuka, Tomohiro Otsuka",2025-12-01,2025-12-01,cond-mat.mes-hall,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02225v1
2512.01874v1,On-chip high-order parametric downconversion in the excitonic Mott insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ for programmable multiphoton entangled states,"Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and four-wave mixing in $χ^{(2)}$ and $χ^{(3)}$ media underpin most entangled-photon sources, but direct generation of higher-order entangled multiphoton states by $n$-th order parametric downconversion remains extremely challenging because conventional materials exhibit tiny high-order nonlinearities. Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an excitonic Mott insulator on a breathing Kagome lattice, supports exceptionally large nonlinear susceptibilities up to seventh order. Many-body GW--Bethe--Salpeter and time-dependent BSE / Kadanoff--Baym simulations yield resonant $χ^{(2)}$--$χ^{(7)}$ for monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, with $|χ^{(4)}|$ and $|χ^{(5)}|$ surpassing values in prototypical transition metal dichalcogenides by 5--9 orders of magnitude. We trace this enhancement to flat bands and strongly bound Frenkel excitons with ferroelectrically aligned out-of-plane dipoles. Building on experimentally demonstrated 1$\times N$ integrated beam splitters with arbitrary power ratios, we propose an on-chip architecture where each output arm hosts an Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ patch, optionally gated by graphene to tune the complex $n$-photon amplitudes. Using the ab-initio $χ^{(3)}$ and $χ^{(4)}$ values, we predict that three-photon GHZ$_3$ and four-photon cluster-state sources in this platform can achieve $n$-photon generation rates up to $\sim 10^8$ and $\sim 10^6$ times larger, respectively, than silica-fiber- and MoS$_2$-based implementations with comparable geometry. We derive the quantum Hamiltonian and explicit $n$-photon generation rates for this platform, and show how suitable interferometric networks enable electrically and spectrally tunable GHZ, $W$, and cluster states based on genuine high-order nonlinear processes in a 2D excitonic Mott insulator.","Dmitry Skachkov, Dirk R.

2512.01346v1,Floquet Chern Insulators and Radiation-Induced Zero Resistance in Irradiated Graphene,"Recent advances in optics and time-resolved techniques have facilitated the exploration of new states of matter under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we predict that irradiated graphene can host two novel nonequilibrium steady states of matter with zero resistance when exposed to circularly polarized light: (i) Floquet Chern insulators and (ii) a radiation-induced zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution. Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width. By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems.","Youngjae Kim, Kwon Park",2025-12-01,2025-12-01,cond-mat.mes-hall,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01346v1

Interlayer coupling between two graphene-like lattices produces band crossings, while relative sliding preserves gapless Dirac points located at generic, low-symmetry $\mathbf{k}$ points. The introduction of Haldane-type complex next-nearest-neighbor hoppings gaps these Dirac points, breaks time-reversal symmetry, and generates a sequence of quantum anomalous Hall phases. Depending on the phase angles $φ_1$ and $φ_2$ associated with the two layers, the system exhibits QAH states with Chern numbers $|C|>2$. The nontrivial bulk topology is verified by the presence of the corresponding number of chiral edge modes in ribbon geometries. These high-Chern-number phases originate from the enhanced twisting of the valence-band manifold induced by interlayer stacking.","H. Minh Lam, V.

To this end, we develop the theory of quantization of screened plasmons, as appropriate for lossless graphene described by a Drude conductivity. By analyzing the resulting band structure, we show that the crystal sustains nontrivial topological bands, with quantized geometric phase. We further show that in a finite, open system, edge states appear within the band gap, which undergo a topological phase transition and merge with bulk states as the modulation increases.

2512.00815v1,Universal Fabrication of Graphene/Perovskite Oxide Hybrid Heterostructures,"Hybrid heterostructures composed of graphene and perovskite oxides provide a promising platform for exploiting synergetic interfacial functionalities. Conventional fabrication methods of the hybrid heterostructures rely on transferring graphene grown on metallic substrates-- a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to introducing numerous defects. In this study, we present a universal, catalyst-free method for the direct growth of graphene on insulating substrates by employing three different perovskite oxide substrates (SrTiO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$, and (La$_{0.18}$Sr$_{0.82}$)(Al$_{0.59}$Ta$_{0.41}$)O$_3$) using atmospheric chemical vapor deposition. Comprehensive characterization via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of a uniform, continuous monolayer graphene on all substrates. We identified that growth temperature critically governs graphene quality, as excessive active species may lead to secondary nucleation and the formation of multilayer graphene. Notably, all substrates shared the same optimal growth conditions. Low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy of the graphene/SrTiO$_3$ hybrid heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling.

2512.00447v1,A Rapid Thermal Chemical Vapor Deposition System for Fast Synthesis of Epitaxial Graphene Under Ambient Pressure,"Graphene has emerged as a promising material for next-generation electronic and thermal devices owing to its exceptional charge transport and thermal conductivity. However, high-quality samples are predominantly obtained via mechanical exfoliation from graphite crystals, a process that inherently lacks scalability. Despite extensive efforts toward large-area synthesis, cost-effective approaches for producing high-quality, large-area, single-crystalline graphene with fast turnaround time remain limited. Here, we report the design, fabrication, and performance benchmarking of a rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) system capable of synthesizing epitaxial monolayer graphene under atmospheric pressure. The entire growth process, from sample loading to unloading, is achieved within $25$ minutes with a temperature ramp rate exceeding $23^\circ\mathrm{C}/s$. Growth at atmospheric pressure eliminates the need for vacuum components, thereby reducing both system complexity and operational costs. The structural and electronic quality of epitaxial graphene is comprehensively characterized using Raman spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and magnetotransport measurements, which reveal signatures of quantum Hall effect in synthesized graphene samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate van der Waals epitaxial growth of palladium (Pd) thin films on graphene transferred to Si/SiO$_{2}$ substrates, establishing its single-crystalline nature over a large area and its potential as a versatile platform for subsequent heteroepitaxial growth.","Shikhar Kumar Gupta, Meet Ghelani, Pragna Datta, Subhalakshmi Guha, Shivesh Yadav, Nilesh Kulkarni, Maheshwar Gokhale, Bhagyashree Chalke, Devendra Buddhikot, Naveen Paneri, Lavudya Devendar, Arnab Bhattacharya, Shouvik Chatterjee",2025-11-29,2025-11-29,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00447v1
2512.00394v1,Wafer-Scale Single-Crystalline Monolayer Graphene,"Producing large-area single-crystalline graphene is key to realizing its full potential in advanced applications, including twistronics. Yet, controlling graphene growth kinetics to avoid grain boundaries or multilayer growth remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate single-crystalline graphene free from multilayer domains via one-step delamination of epitaxial graphene from silicon carbide (SiC). This is enabled by a specific surface reconstruction of 4H-SiC(0001) achieved in our growth conditions. High crystalline quality is confirmed by the observation of the half-integer quantum Hall effect -- the hallmark of monolayer graphene -- in near cm-sized crystals. The scalability of our process, explored with 4''-wafers, represents an advance toward large-scale integration of high-performance graphene applications.","Johanna Huhtasaari, Joyal Jain Palakulam, Awse Salha, Per Hyldgaard, Elsebeth Schröder, Magnus Hårdensson Berntsen, Oscar Tjernberg, Manasi Shah, Rodrigo Martinez-Duarte, Hans He, Johannes Hofmann, Thilo Bauch, Naveen Shetty, Samuel Lara-Avila",2025-11-29,2025-11-29,cond-mat.mes-hall,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00394v1
2512.00180v1,Resonant Dyakonov-Shur Magnetoplasmons in Graphene Terahertz Photodetectors,"Graphene plasmons confine incident terahertz fields far below the diffraction limit and, when hosted by a gate-defined Fabry-Perot cavity, enable electrically tunable, frequency-selective photodetectors. In a magnetic field, these plasmons hybridize with the cyclotron motion to form magnetoplasmons, offering a platform for fundamental studies and for nonreciprocal, spectrally selective, ultrasensitive terahertz photonics. However, implementing magnetoplasmon-assisted resonant transistors at terahertz frequencies has remained challenging so far. Here we use gate-dependent, on-chip terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy combined with a perpendicular magnetic field to resolve and probe the evolution of resonant magnetoplasmons in antenna-coupled monolayer and bilayer graphene TeraFETs. In monolayer graphene the dispersion reflects the Dirac nature of the carriers, exhibiting a non-monotonic density dependence due to the interplay of plasma resonance and cyclotron motion, with an inflection point at maximal plasmon-cyclotron coupling. In contrast, in bilayer graphene we recover and map a magnetoplasmon dispersion consistent with the conventional Schrödinger-type picture. These results establish graphene TeraFET devices as a robust on-chip platform for resonant magnetoplasmonics at terahertz frequencies, enabling magnetically programmable, frequency-selective photonics and opening avenues toward photodetectors with enhanced sensitivity.","Juan A.

2511.22980v2,Interaction-Driven Chern Insulator at Zero Electric Field in ABCB-Stacked Tetralayer Graphene,"ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.","Yulu Ren, Yang Shen, Chengyang Xu, Wanfei Shan, Weidong Luo",2025-11-28,2025-12-03,cond-mat.mes-hall,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22980v2
2511.22796v1,Correlations between superconducting and resistive anisotropies,"There are multiple possible origins of transport anisotropies in metals and superconductors. For instance, rotational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the normal state as a result of electronic nematic order inducing anisotropies in an otherwise $s$-wave superconducting phase. Another possibility is that the dominant source of rotational symmetry breaking is the superconductor itself and its vestiges that may survive in the normal state. We here theoretically analyze the correlations of transport anisotropies in the normal and the corresponding superconducting phase for different scenarios of broken symmetry, either coming solely from the normal state, solely from the superconductor and its vestiges in the metallic regimes, or from both simultaneously. We further include both zero-momentum and finite-momentum pairing; we develop a theory of vestigial order for the latter, characterized by broken rotational and translational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the relative transport anisotropies in the normal and superconducting phases sensitively depend on the scenario, including the form of vestigial order and, in some cases, the parity of the superconducting order parameter. As such, measuring the directional dependence of the critical current and resistivity can provide strong constraints on the origin of rotational symmetry breaking. We demonstrate our findings in minimal models relevant to twisted multilayer graphene, rhombohedral graphene, and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.","Sayan Banerjee, Harley D.

2511.22714v1,Tetrahedral Core in a Sea of Competing Magnetic Phases in Graphene,"We reveal the emergence of a robust tetrahedral magnetic ground state in monolayer graphene doped to the van Hove singularity (vHS). This noncoplanar, gapped spin configuration -- featuring four orthogonal moments -- has been previously identified as a candidate instability. Here, not only do we confirm its stability across all finite interactions using fully self-consistent, real-space-resolved calculations, but we also go beyond earlier work by charting the full surrounding phase diagram. In doing so, we unravel a cascade of symmetry-broken magnetic states -- pseudo-tetrahedral, planar, collinear, and modulated textures -- which we classify using spin structure factors and vector order parameters. These results stem from unrestricted Hartree-Fock simulations on large supercells with dense k-point sampling, enabling us to resolve interaction-driven magnetic and charge inhomogeneities. Our findings connect directly with recent ARPES and doping experiments near the vHS in graphene, and establish the tetrahedral state as the central correlated instability in this regime, offering predictive insight into emergent magnetism in correlated Dirac materials.","Maxime Lucas, Arnaud Ralko, Andreas Honecker, Guy Trambly de Laissardière",2025-11-27,2025-11-27,cond-mat.str-el,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22714v1
2511.22713v1,"Majorana modes in graphene strips: polarization, wavefunctions, disorder, and Andreev states","Topologically protected Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have attracted intense interest due to their potential application in fault-tolerant quantum computation (TQC). Graphene nanoribbons, with tunable edge terminations and compatibility with planar device architectures, offer a promising alternative to semiconductor nanowires. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical study of finite graphene strips with armchair, zigzag, and nearly square geometries, proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder. Using exact diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes tight-binding Hamiltonian, we analyze Majorana polarization, low-energy spectra, and real-space wavefunctions to identify the non-trivial topological phases supporting MZMs and distinguish them from from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or the quasi-Majoranas. We systematically chart the robustness of these modes across geometries and disorder regimes, finding that armchair strips with short zigzag edges provide the most stable platform. Our results unify polarization diagnostics with spatial wavefunction analysis and disorder effects, yielding concrete design guidelines for graphene-based topological superconductors.","Shubhanshu Karoliya, Sumanta Tewari, Gargee Sharma",2025-11-27,2025-11-27,cond-mat.mes-hall,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22713v1

Our Landauer-Buttiker analysis and numerical simulations show that a monotonically varying density gradient combined with a full equilibration mechanism can explain these phenomena. Our results also suggest the presence of trivial long-range chiral edge current and offer a broadly applicable way to engineer transport properties in quantum Hall systems.","Wenxue He, Shijin Li, Jinhao Cheng, Yingpeng Zhang, Kaixuan Fan, Jiabo Liu, Shuaishuai Ding, Wenping Hu, Fan Yang, Chen Wang, Qing-Feng Sun, Hechen Ren",2025-11-27,2025-11-27,cond-mat.mes-hall,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22400v1
